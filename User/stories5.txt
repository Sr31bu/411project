5. As a unlogin user, I want to register a user account to store the music that I like. Having login credentials is very important 
because it allows save all their data like their music playlist, recommendations. If they didn't have a login credentials, that means all
their won't be saved. If everything goes right, they'll be able to create a login to save their content of their music. If something goes wrong where
they have forgot their password, or haven't registered an account yet, we will provide an option for them to register a account, and reset their password.
I think the most important thing is to have an account to save the users music data because it will be time consuming for them to just
browse through musics and add it to playlist.
