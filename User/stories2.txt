2. As a login user, I want to be able to manage my lists. I can create lists, add or delete musics. What the user can do here is that 
it would allow users themselves to create a list of all the musics that they wanted to add to their playlist to listen to wherever and whenever
they want to listen. Because we don't want to overcomplicate the users adding songs, we want to keep it simple and add the songs but not adding 
other things like the authors name. We want to also allow users to delete musics as well if they don't like it or that they can move the music
to another playlist. That way, users can be able to happy listening to just their music playlist and not listened to millions of songs.
