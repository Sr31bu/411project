1. As a login user, I want to search for some musics and add them to my lists. I want to search musics based on song's name, author name, music genres etc.
   The idea behind this story is that we want users to do what they want to do with their music. There are over thousands of musics around the web so sometimes
   it would be hard to only search for the songs that you liked. We want users to be able to search their songs that they like to listen to often and we do that by
   having a search option for them to discover musics whether it's by the song name, author name, music genres, etc. If everything goes right, they would be able to
   search their music based on their preferences. If something goes wrong, it would mean that the web frozed, lost internet, server crashed/delay, and maybe the wrong
   song suggestion.
