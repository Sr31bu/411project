3. As a login user, I want to see some music recommandations, so that I can explore more musics that I may also like. For this purpose,
we want users to have the option some new music that they may like so that they can try listen to it. We think that users sometimes may get 
bored on listening the same music over and over again so we want to offer them a chance to look up new songs to listen to. That way, the
user will use this application more often because we help simplify it for them rather than search up the songs individually. We were thinking
of music recommandations through identify what the users preferences are such that we can return a variety of songs that will fit into 
what they like.
