What the user can do is that they can leave comments to a song that they've listened to such that it would communicate with others that may also like this song 
as well. That way, we can allow other users to have the opportunity to talk more about what they may or may not like about a song. We feel like having the option to 
share comments about the reasons why they like they song would help them be more engage in the trends of the song. That way, we can see how everyone reacts to a song so
it can give people insight on what they would like to say when they listen to it.
